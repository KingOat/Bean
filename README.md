# Bean Engine

This is my first ever attempt at creating a game engine, this game engine is written in python 
and thus won't offer much in terms of performance. I have decided to make this project in order 
to sharpen my skills in the python programming language, as well as make sure i understood the
programming paradigms necessary to make a game engine.
